Learning effectively isn’t just about putting in more hours—it’s about using the right strategies. Below are key
evidence-based techniques that can help improve memory, deepen understanding, and boost problem-solving skills. Whether
you're preparing for exams or mastering new skills, these tools can make your learning process faster, more enjoyable,
and far more effective.

## Modes of Thinking: Focused vs. Diffuse

When it comes to learning and solving problems, we actually use two very different ways of thinking, and both are
essential:

* **Focused Mode** is when you put all your attention on one task—think of it as laser-focused concentration. This is
  great when you’re diving into details, solving problems you’ve seen before, or working through a list of instructions.
* **Diffuse Mode** is a bit more relaxed. It’s when your mind wanders, and you're not actively concentrating. This is
  actually the time when your brain makes creative connections, and it’s especially helpful when you're stuck on a
  problem or dealing with something unfamiliar.

The key is knowing when to switch between these modes to help your brain form stronger connections and think more
creatively. [^1]

## Pomodoro Technique

If staying focused for long periods feels like a struggle, the **Pomodoro Technique** could be your new best friend.
Here’s how it works:

* Focus hard for **25 minutes**
* Take a **5-minute break**
* After you’ve done four of these “Pomodoros,” take a longer break (15–30 minutes)

This method isn’t just about keeping you on track—it helps reduce fatigue and keeps you motivated throughout your study
session. [^2]

## Active Recall

Instead of passively re-reading your notes or highlighting text, **active recall** has you actively engage with the
material. This could be as simple as testing yourself on what you’ve learned, using flashcards, or even explaining
concepts to someone else.

Studies show that this approach is far more effective than passive learning because it strengthens the neural pathways
that make the information stick. [^3]

## Spaced Repetition

We all know how frustrating it is to forget something right after learning it. But the forgetting curve, a concept
introduced by psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, explains why this happens. Ebbinghaus found that people tend to forget a
large portion of new information very quickly—about 60% of what we learn is forgotten within 24 hours if not reviewed.
The curve flattens over time, meaning that the more we reinforce what we've learned, the less likely we are to forget
it.
[^4]

This is where spaced repetition comes in. By revisiting material at increasing intervals (e.g., after 1 day, then 3
days, then a week), you effectively interrupt the natural forgetting curve, keeping the information fresh in your mind.
This method doesn't just help you remember—it embeds knowledge into long-term memory.
[^5]

And if you combine spaced repetition with active recall (actively retrieving information from memory), you're hitting
two powerful techniques at once, ensuring that what you learn sticks around for the long term.

## Interleaving

**Interleaving** might sound like a fancy term, but it’s simple in practice. Instead of studying one subject or problem
type for a long time, try mixing up different topics in a single session. While it may feel harder at first, it actually
improves your ability to learn over the long term by teaching you how to switch between concepts and apply them more
flexibly.

This method might challenge your brain, but the payoff is worth it. [^6]

## Mnemonics

One of the easiest ways to remember complex information is with **mnemonics**—these are memory aids that use patterns
like acronyms, rhymes, or vivid images.

A classic example: **ROY G BIV** stands for the colors of the rainbow—Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.
It's simple, but it works! [^7]
