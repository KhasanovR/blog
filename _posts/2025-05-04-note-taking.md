title: "Note Taking"
---

An intentional and structured capture of information, which is distilled, organized, and externalized in real time to
serve as a cognitive scaffold and a personalized repository to enhance comprehension, retention, and future retrieval.

**Note-taking**:

- the disciplined practice of transforming transient information into structured, external representations, facilitating
  deeper cognitive processing, critical analysis, and long-term retention.
- the art of catching thoughts mid-flight—pinning them gently to the page before they vanish into the ether, creating a
  map of meaning from the fleeting whispers of understanding.
- your brain’s external hard drive—quick, searchable, and customized to your thinking style.

## Why Note-Taking Matters

- **Memory retention**: Combat Ebbinghaus' Forgetting Curve (40% information loss within 24 hours)
- **Cognitive processing**: Handwritten notes activate different neural pathways than typing
- **Active engagement**: Transform passive listening into active learning
- **Dual functionality**: Serves both encoding (learning during note-taking) and storage (future reference)

## Traditional Note-Taking Systems

### Cornell Method

- **Structure**: Notes column (right), cue column (left), summary area (bottom)
- **Process**: Record notes, create cues/questions within 24 hours, summarize main points
- **Best for**: Lectures, exam preparation, structured learning

### Outline Method

- Hierarchical organization with main topics, subtopics, and supporting details
- Shows relationships between ideas through indentation
- Best for subjects with clear hierarchies and structured content

```txt
I. Naming Conventions
    A. Importance of good names
        1. Improves readability
        2. Reduces the need for comments
        3. Enhances collaboration
    B. Rules for naming
        1. Use intention-revealing names
            a. getUserAge() instead of data1()
            b. Helps others understand code faster
        2. Avoid disinformation
            a. Don’t use list for arrays or temp for permanent variables
            b. Prevents confusion
        3. Make names pronounceable
            a. Use employeeCount not empCnt
            b. Easier communication during discussions

### Mapping Methods

- **Mind Maps**: Radiate from central concept with branches, colors, and images
- **Concept Maps**: Structured diagrams with labeled connections between concepts
- Best for visual learners and seeing relationships between ideas

### Charting Method

- Organize information in columns for systematic comparison
- Excellent for comparing data points across consistent categories

| Method	 | Description | Application | 	Examples | Reference |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Topic 1 |             |             |           |           |
| Topic 2 |             |             |           |           |
| Topic 3 |             |             |           |           |

## Knowledge Management Systems

### Zettelkasten (Slip Box)

- **Core principles**: Atomic notes, unique identifiers, explicit connections
- **Process**: Create one-idea notes, link related concepts, use your own words
- **Best for**: Research, writing projects, building long-term knowledge

### Evergreen Notes

- Concept-oriented, densely linked notes that evolve over time
- Focus on creating notes useful for your future self
- Best for long-term knowledge development and idea synthesis

| Feature       | Evergreen Note                           | Zettel                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose       | Thought development & long-term thinking | Academic writing & research thinking        |
| Structure     | Clean, well-written, standalone          | Shorter, ID-based, sometimes rough          |
| Links         | Organic & intentional                    | Dense, systemic, networked                  |
| Style         | More polished                            | More raw, sometimes just fragments          |
| System Origin | Influenced by personal knowledge systems | Rooted in Zettelkasten method (Luhmann)     |
| Tool-Friendly | Obsidian, Roam, Logseq                   | The same tools—but used in a more rigid way |

## Digital Note-Taking Tools

### Linear vs. Non-Linear Systems

- **Linear**: Traditional document organization (folders, hierarchies)
- **Non-linear**: Connection-focused with linking and flexible organization

### Key Tools

- **Notion**: All-in-one workspace with databases and templates
- **Obsidian**: Local markdown files with powerful linking and visualization
- **Roam Research**: Block-based system emphasizing bidirectional links
- **Annotation Tools**: Highlight and comment on existing documents

## Finding Your Perfect System

Consider:

1. **Your purpose**: Class notes, research, personal knowledge?
2. **Learning style**: Visual, systematic, connective?
3. **Practical constraints**: Time available, collaboration needs?
4. **Technical comfort**: Simple analog to complex digital?

## Science-Backed Note-Taking Principles

- **Generation Effect**: Creating content improves retention vs. passive recording
- **Testing Effect**: Retrieving information strengthens memory
- **Dual Coding**: Information encoded both verbally and visually is better remembered

---

## Context Matters

Note-taking approaches vary for:

- **Academic settings**: Focus on understanding and study preparation
- **Research**: Emphasis on connections and retrievability
- **Meetings**: Clarity and action items
- **Personal use**: Flexibility and individual goals

**Remember**: The best system is the one you'll consistently use. Your note-taking system should evolve as you
do—serving your learning rather than requiring you to serve it.
