# **Ultralearning**: _Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career_

## Book Overview 
*Ultralearning* is a self-directed and intense strategy to acquire fresh ideas, subjects & skills which are helpful for our lives, studies & careers.
### My Purpose for Reading 
I'm reading this book to develop more effective learning techniques and potentially design my own ultralearning projects to acquire new skills more efficiently. 
### Main Thesis 
Young tries to demonstrate that people can master challenging skills faster by using his learning method which is strategic, intensive and self-directed.
## Foreword
In the foreword of the book, [[James Clear]],author of [[Atomic Habits]], mentions that one of the reasons for his calls with Scott is the interest to find out more about building good habits and breaking bad ones. Additionally, Both James and Scott have a bias toward action. Then, he mentions the importance of putting the knowledge to use rather than accumulating it. Also he mentions about _"learning by doing"_ with his own experience by taking 100 000 photos in a year which led him to becoming a finalist of Travel Photographer of the Year. 
__Learning Something New__ $\neq$ __Practicing Something New__. 
James' first ultralearning project was a career as a photographer. The next project was becoming an entrepreneur by writing. He followed the 9 principles mentioned in the book step by step.
- *Principle #1*: **Metalearning** by examining other popular bloggers & authors and their methods in order to create a map to follow.
- *Principle #2*: **Focus** by full-time commitment as a writer (reading and writing)
- *Principle #3*: **Directness** by learning writing by __writing__ (150+ essays in first 2 years)
- *Principle #4*: **Drill** by systematically breaking down each aspect of writing articles in order to polish
- *Principle #6*: **Feedback** by emailing ~10 000 subscribers to get their feedback on the writing.
- ...and so on.
By following Scott's method, _James Clear_ was able to write _Atomic Habits_ which was a _New York Times_ bestselling book.
Reasons to become a ultralearner:
- A sense of purpose in life
- High returns by learning new knowledge & skills
- Achievability
